        <p>Hi there! Let me introduce myself. I am Johnny Nash currently a junior at NAU. I recently switched to online to start a career as a supervisor for McDonalds! I still want to get my bachelors degree but now I am pursuing Cybersecurity when prior it was computer engineering. I have always loved technology from a very young age and i want to make it safe for everyone without destroying human socialization. I recently became a father and I want my baby girl to live in a world where technology is a safe resource and not a way of life.</p>
